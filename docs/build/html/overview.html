<p>The LAPART neural networks couple two Fuzzy ART algorithms to create a mechanism for making
predictions based on learned associations. The coupling of the two Fuzzy ARTs has a unique
stability that allows the system to converge rapidly towards a clear solution. Additionally,
it can perform logical inference and supervised learning similar to fuzzy ARTMAP.</p>

<h2>Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The general layout of the LAPART algorithm includes two fuzzy ARTs, labeled as A and B, that
are connected by an associator matrix referred to as L. These two Fuzzy ARTs are very similar
to the algorithms described in Section 4.1.1. Each of them have an input layer, a recognition
layer, and a categorization layer. Also, they both have a vigilance parameter ⇢A,⇢B respectively.
The A and B algorithms are connected together by an inference mechanism so that the template
connections are established during training and then used to provide predictions during testing.
The flow of the algorithm is shown in Figure 4.10. During training, the system is able to learn
through the presentation of input pattern pairs (IA{x1..xn} and IB{y1..yn}) applied to each
Fuzzy ART network [48]. At the same time, interconnections between classes are formed in the L
matrix. The interconnections between the A and B Fuzzy ART connect the learned categories and
allow for predictions to be made in the testing phase when new data becomes available. During
testing, as shown in Figure 4.11, previously unseen data are presented to the A side only.
Categorization of the input patterns occurs in the A side which connects, through the L matrix,
to a particular category on the B side. The particular B side category for the input pattern is
then the prediction for the given A input.</p>

<h3>Fuzzy ART A<a class="headerlink" href="#fuzzy-art-a" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The training process is initiated with the presentation of an input pattern into the Fuzzy
ART A algorithm. Since no templates exist at the onset of the training the initial input
becomes the first template on the A-side. Therefore, a new template or class would be created
and based on Figure 4.12 decision block, “New A Class”, the algorithm implemented Case 1
script. In this situation, the Fuzzy ART B operates as a normal ART algorithm. Since there
are no B-Side templates, a new template was automatically created and a link between the A
and B Fuzzy ARTs are established in the L matrix.</p>
<p>The algorithm then starts over with a new input, and repeats until all of the inputs are
considered. When the new input is presented to all of the existing templates, in the
“A-Side Search” block, it searched for the top matches as determined by the choice function.
Then the vigilance test is computed in the “A-Side Resonance” block to determine if
resonance with an existing template occurs or not. If resonance does not occur then the
next best template was considered until no choices were left. If a match is not found,
then the script for Case 1 is implemented. If a match does occur, the script for Case 2 is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="case-1">
<h3>Case 1<a class="headerlink" href="#case-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Case 1 code scenario occurs when a new A-side class was created and the Fuzzy ART B is
allowed to operate as a normal ART algorithm. First, a new A-Side template is created. Then
the B-Side input pattern is presented to the “B-Side Search” block where the choice function
is used to discover the best template match. After the best match is found, the system tested
the match to see if it met the vigilance parameter criteria in the “B-Side Resonance” block. If
it did not, then a new template is created. If it did, then it updates an existing template.
After the creation or update of a B-Side template, the inference matrix L was updated to link
the newly created A-Side template to the B-Side template.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="case-2">
<h3>Case 2<a class="headerlink" href="#case-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the event that resonance occurred in the Fuzzy ART A section of the code then Case 2 is
implemented. First, the A-side template that resonated with the input pattern is not updated,
but instead put on hold until further notice. Also, the match function is used to find the
template that best matched the given input pattern. Then, if the chosen template passed the
vigilance criteria, where the match function was greater than or equal to the B-side vigilance
(⇢B), then the given A and B side templates are updated respectively. But, if it does not pass,
then the system experiences a lateral reset and the initial A-side template is hidden and the
process is repeated.</p>
