==================================
Laterally Primed Adaptive Resonance Theory (LAPART) was created by Michael J. Healy and Thomas P. Caudell. 
The artificial neural network is a supervised learning algorithm.  The algorithm couples two Fuzzy Adatpvie 
Resonance Theory (ART) neural networks to create a mechanism for making predictions based
on learned associations.  The coupling of the two Fuzzy ARTs has a unique stability that allows
it to converge rapidly towards a clear solution.  It can also performa logical inference and 
supervised learning similar to fuzzy ARTMAP.
